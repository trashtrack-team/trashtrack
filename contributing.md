### Project Standards

-   Folder name should use singular case and short version of the word if possible (e.g. lib, util, src, asset & etc).

-   Naming for CRUD, HTTP Request and normal operation should be different from one another
    -   CRUD: Create, Read, Update and Delete
    -   HTTP Request: Post, Get, Put and Delete
    -   Normal Operation (Controllers & Services): Add, Find, Change and Remove
